<h2><a id="about">About the Engine</a></h2>
<p>
In March of 2010, I wrote a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel">visual novel</a> (VN) to
explain hypothesis testing to my Psychology
Research Methods class. I used the <a href="http://www.renpy.org/">Ren'py</a>
visual novel engine, and it worked great.
Grant Paton-Simpson, the author of
<a href="http://sofastatistics.com/">SOFA - Statistics Open For All</a>
liked the content, but said he would prefer if it were web-based instead of
having to download an executable file.
</p>

<p>
After some experimentation, I have come up with a visual novel engine written
in JavaScript. It is not meant as a replacement for Ren'py, nor is it
intended to do everything that Ren'py does. I have tried to make it general
enough to do a variety of simple VNs, but my main purpose was to adapt
a single visual novel to the web. If it serves your purposes too, that&#8217;s
great.
</p>

<p>
Although the engine was inspired by Ren'py, it is not a copy.
Just as Ren'py is written in Python and &#8220;plays well&#8221; with that
language, this engine was written to work in an HTML/CSS/JavaScript
environment, and its notation is closely linked to that environment.
</p>

<h2><a id="bigPicture">The Big Picture</a></h2>
<p>
From a conceptual level, a visual novel takes place in two screen areas:
the <dfn>tableau</dfn>, where all the images appear, and the
<dfn>dialog area</dfn>, where the characters&#8217; speech appears. The
novel is populated by <dfn>actors</dfn>, which can either be
<dfn>characters</dfn> (people, animals, magical beings, etc.), <dfn>text blocks</dfn> (used to display text that
isn&#8217;t someone&#8217;s speech in the tableau), or
<dfn>menu items</dfn>, which let you take different paths through the
novel.
</p>

<p>
The novel has a <dfn>script</dfn> that lets you specify which characters
appear at what times, what they say, and how the menu items let the reader
take a path through the novel. This is not the same as your
<code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element that lets you put JavaScript into
your HTML file. Speaking of that, though, let&#8217;s look at:
</p>

<h2><a id="htmlFile">The HTML File</a></h2>
<p>
This tutorial will create a sample novel in file 
<a href="exampleNovel.html"><samp>exampleNovel.html</samp></a>.
It is not a particularly interesting
visual novel (in fact, its plot line is non-existent); rather, it&#8217;s
designed to be an example of, well, an example.
</p>

<p>
In the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of your document, you must include
the visual novel JavaScript file, with markup like this. In this example,
the JavaScript is in the same directory as the HTML file. For this tutorial,
all the images the novel uses will be placed in a subdirectory named
<code>images</code>, and audio will be placed in a subdirectory named
<code>audio</code>. There&#8217;s no law that says you must do this, but
it&#8217;s a good idea to keep from having one directory with an
unmanageable number of files in it.
</p>

<div class="inset bordered"><pre>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="visual_novel.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre></div>

<p>You will also include a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element that
refers to the JavaScript that describes your novel.
For this example, the file will be named
<samp>exampleNovel.js</samp>, and it will reside in the same directory as 
the HTML file.
</p>

<div class="inset bordered"><pre>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="exampleNovel.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre></div>

<h3><a id="body">Setting up the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code></h3>
<p>
In the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> of the document, you set up the
tableau and dialog areas, as well as an area for the background image
of the tableau. Here is a sample setup. The line numbers at the left are
for the explanation that follows; don&#8217;t enter them into your markup.
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre><span class="line"> 1&nbsp;</span>&lt;body onload="initNovel(800, 600);"&gt;
<span class="line"> 2&nbsp;</span>&lt;div id="novelDiv"&gt;
<span class="line"> 3&nbsp;</span>    &lt;div style="position: absolute;
<span class="line"> 4&nbsp;</span>        left:0; top: 0; z-index:-1"&gt;
<span class="line"> 5&nbsp;</span>        &lt;img id="background0" src="images/empty.png"&gt;
<span class="line"> 6&nbsp;</span>    &lt;/div&gt;
<span class="line"> 7&nbsp;</span>    &lt;div style="position: absolute;
<span class="line"> 8&nbsp;</span>        left:0; top: 0; z-index:-1"&gt;
<span class="line"> 9&nbsp;</span>        &lt;img id="background1" src="images/empty.png"&gt;
<span class="line">10&nbsp;</span>    &lt;/div&gt;
<span class="line">11&nbsp;</span>    &lt;div id="dialogDiv" style="z-index:100"&gt;
<span class="line">12&nbsp;</span>    &lt;/div&gt;
<span class="line">13&nbsp;</span>&lt;/div&gt;
<span class="line">14&nbsp;</span>&lt;div style="text-align:center; margin-top: 0.5em;"&gt;
<span class="line">15&nbsp;</span>&lt;input type="button" value="Back to Beginning"
<span class="line">16&nbsp;</span>    onclick="initNovel(800, 450)"/&gt;
<span class="line">17&nbsp;</span>&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
</div>

<dl>
<dt>Line 1</dt>
    <dd>When the document finishes loading, initialize the novel.
    The numbers in the parentheses give the width and height of the
    tableau in pixels. In this example, the tableau is 800 pixels wide
    and 450 pixels high.</dd>
<dt>Line 2</dt>
    <dd>This is the tableau. Its <code>id</code> <em>must</em> be
    <samp>"novelDiv"</samp>.</dd>
<dt>Lines 3-4</dt>
    <dd>In order to allow background images to fade in or out, you must
    include this <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> The <code>position</code>,
    <code>left</code>, and <code>top</code> make the background image appear
    at the upper left of the tableau; the <code>z-index:&nbsp;-1</code>
    ensures that the background image appears behind the characters.</dd>
<dt>Line 5</dt>
    <dd>The first background image must have an <code>id="background0"</code>.
    In this case, the initial background is a totally transparent image.
    </dd>
<dt>Lines 7-10</dt>
    <dd>The second backgound image; this is required in order to allow
    a <dfn>dissolve</dfn>, where one image fades in as the other fades out.
    </dd>
<dt>Lines 11-12</dt>
    <dd>This is the dialog area, whose <code>id</code> <em>must</em> be
    <samp>"dialogDiv"</samp>.
    If your <code>&lt;div&nbsp;id="dialogDiv"&gt;</code> is inside the
    <code>&lt;div&nbsp;id="novelDiv"&gt;</code> (as it is in the
    sample novel, &#8220;The Question&#8221;), you must add
    <code>style="z-index:100"</code> to the <code>dialogDiv</code> to
    ensure that the dialog always appears above the characters.
    </dd>
<dt>Lines 14-17</dt>
    <dd>These are optional. It&#8217;s just a good idea to allow readers
    to restart the novel. The <code>onclick</code> re-initializes the
    novel, just as you did in line 1.</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a id="styling">Styling the novel</a></h3>
<p>
At this point, you can use CSS to attach styles to the tableau,
dialog area, and menu items. Here is a sample. First, the tableau.
The width and height must match the numbers you specified in the
call to <code>initNovel()</code>, and the <code>position: relative</code>
is required in order to place the image properly within in the tableau.
The <code>text-align:&nbsp;center</code> on the <code>body</code> is
necessary in order for the tableau to be centered horizontally on the
screen when using Internet Explorer.
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre>body {
    text-align: center;
}

#novelDiv {
    width: 800px;
    height: 600px;
    border: 1px solid black;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
    position: relative;
    text-align: center;
}</pre>
</div>

<p>
The dialog, in this case, is within the tableau rather than below it.
The padding plus the width add up to 800 pixels so that the borders
coincide.
</p>

<div class="inset bordered"><pre>#dialogDiv {
    font-family: "Deja Vu Sans", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
    font-size: 20px;
    position: absolute;
    width: 790px;
    height: 140px;
    top: 450px;
    left: 0;
    padding: 5px;
    background-color: #3d372c;
    color: white;
    text-align: left;
    filter: alpha(opacity=75);
    opacity: 0.75;
}</pre>
</div>

<p>
Finally, add styling for menu items. Of course, these sizes and
colors are just an example; you may change them to reflect the look you
want for your novel.
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre>.menuItem {
    font-family: "Deja Vu Sans", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
    font-size: 18px;
    background-color: #0050a0;
    color: white;
    text-align: center;
    width: 75%;
    margin: 0.5em auto;
    padding: 0.5em 3em;
    -moz-border-radius: 15px;
    border-radius: 15px;
}

.menuItem:hover {
    background-color: #ff8c00;
}</pre>
</div>

<h2><a id="jsFile">The novel file</a></h2>
<p>
Now, turn your attention to the <code>exampleNovel.js</code> file. This is
where you will describe the novel&#8217;s actors and write the script
that puts them through their paces.
</p>

<h3><a id="preload">Preloading Images</a></h3>
<p>
If you have a lot of fairly large images, you want them to be available
as soon as your novel needs them. You can start a preloading process to
have the browser retrieve the images while the rest of the page loads.
Create an array with the names of the files you want to preload.
Here is an example. Notice that the <code>images/</code> directory
isn&#8217;t in the file names; that saves some typing.
(<a href="show_pics.html">See the pictures that this example preloads.</a>)
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre>var preload = [
  "hills1.jpg", "hills2.jpg",
  "amazed1.png", "amazed2.png",
  "cool1.png", "cool2.png",
  "hand_waving1.png", "hand_waving2.png",
  "laughing1.png", "laughing2.png",
  "loving1.png", "loving2.png",
  "simple1.png", "simple2.png",
  "smiling1.png", "smiling2.png",
  "sad1.png", "sad2.png",
  "silence1.png", "silence2.png",
  "angry1.png"
];</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now add this code to do the actual preloading; here is where you
will use the name of the path to the <code>images</code> directory.
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre>var preloadObj = new Array(preload.length);
for (var i = 0; i &lt; preload.length; i++)
{
    preloadObj[i] = new Image();
    preloadObj[i].src = "images/" + preload[i];
}</pre>
</div>

<h3><a id="declare">Declaring Variables</a></h3>
<p>
The next part of the JavaScript files declares all the variables you
will need for the script itself, your characters, textblocks, and
(optionally) positions that your script will use. The next line is
absolutely essential; it is the variable that will hold your script,
and it must be named <code>script</code>.
</p>

<div class="inset bordered"><pre>var script;</pre></div>

<p>
Now, reserve variables for your main characters. In this tutorial, there
are two main characters named Tyler (a tourist) and
Gavin (a guide), along with a narrator.
There will also be two pseudo-characters: one used
to display photos or diagrams, and a text block used to display text in
the tableau.
</p>
<p>
The following example also declares variables used to specify the position
of characters. Tyler and Gavin will appear at the lower left and lower right
side of the window, and the diagram will appear in the upper center.
Although you can declare multiple variables on one line in
JavaScript, code is easier to
read and maintain if you put one variable per line. You can use any variable
names you want for your characters. It&#8217;s best if they resemble the
characters&#8217; actual names, but you can keep them short to save yourself
some typing.
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre>var tyler;
var gavin;
var n; // short for "narrator"
var photo;
var textBlock;

var leftSide;
var rightSide;
var upperCenter;</pre>
</div>

<h3><a id="prepare">Preparing the Novel</a></h3>
<p>
Actual initialization of the variables takes place in a function which
<em>must</em> be named <code>prepareNovel</code>. The first two lines
will give the path to the sub-folders where your images and audio live.
In this case, there&#8217;s no audio, so the <code>audioPath</code> is set to
<code>""</code>. If you aren&#8217;t using a sub-folder for your images
or audio, you should also set the path to <code>""</code>.
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre>function prepareNovel()
{
    novel.imagePath = "images/"; // path to your image directory
    novel.audioPath = ""; // path to your audio directory</pre>
</div>

<p>
Continuing the function, initialize the characters. A character is
initialized by giving the name and the color in which his name appears
when he speaks in the dialog area. The name must be in quote marks
and can include blanks. The color may be in any format that would be
acceptable in CSS. Because the narrator doesn&#8217;t have a name,
no name will appear when he &#8220;speaks,&#8221; so you don&#8217;t have
to specify a color.
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre>    gavin = new Character("Gavin", {color: "rgb(64, 204, 64)"});
    tyler = new Character("Tyler", {color: "#ffff00"});
    n = new Character("");
</pre>
</div>

<h3><a id="positions">Specifying Positions</a></h3>

<p>To specify a position on the screen, you give four numbers:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <i>x</i>-coordinate. If this number is less than or equal
    to 1, it is taken as a decimal percent of the novel&#8217;s width.
    If it is greater than 1, it is taken as a number of pixels.</li>
    <li>The <i>y</i>-coordinate. If this number is less than or equal
    to 1, it is taken as a decimal percent of the novel&#8217;s height.
    If it is greater than 1, it is taken as a number of pixels.</li>
    <li>The <i>x</i> <dfn>anchor</dfn>, a number from 0 to 1 (explanation of anchors
    follows)</li>
    <li>The <i>y</i> anchor, a number from 0 to 1</li>
</ul>

<p>You may omit the last two numbers, in which case they will be
presumed to be zero. <span class="warning">Warning:</span> this may
change to a default of 0.5 in later versions, depending upon feedback from
authors who use the novel engine.
</p>

<p>
An <dfn>anchor</dfn> tells how far to offset the top or left point of an image.
Consider these three positions:
</p>

<div class="inset bordered"><pre>
place1 = new Position(300, 400, 0, 0);
place2 = new Position(300, 400, 0.5, 0.5);
place3 = new Position(300, 400, 1, 0);</pre>
</div>

<p>
Let&#8217;s say one of your characters has an image that is 200 pixels wide
and 150 pixels tall. If you display the character at <code>place1</code>, the
upper left corner of the image will be at coordinate (300, 400) in the
tableau, because the anchors are zero; there is no offset.
</p>

<p>
If you display the image at <code>place2</code>, the left coordinate will
be shifted left by one-half the image width, and the top coordinate will
be shifted up by one-half the image height. That will make the
upper left corner of the image appear at 
(300&nbsp;-&nbsp;(200&nbsp;*&nbsp;0.5),&nbsp;400&nbsp;-&nbsp;(150&nbsp;*&nbsp;0.5)),
or
(200,&nbsp;325). In effect, this will put the
center of the picture at (300,&nbsp;400).
</p>

<p>If you display the image at <code>place3</code>, the left coordinate will
be shifted left the entire image width, and the top coordinate will be
not change. That will make the upper left
coordinate of the image appear at (100, 400),
effectively putting the right edge of the picture at <i>x</i>-coordinate
300.
</p>

<p>
Here are the four positions that the example novel uses.
</p>

<div class="inset bordered"><pre>    leftSide = new Position(0, .75, 0, 1);
    rightSide = new Position(800, 450, 1, 1);
    upperCenter = new Position(0.5, 0.3, 0.5, 0.5);
    rightTop = new Position(0.9, 0.1, 1, 0);</pre>
</div>

<p>
The <code>leftSide</code> position will place images so that their
left side is at the left of the screen and their bottom side is
three-fourths of the way down the tableau.
</p>

<p>
The <code>rightSide</code> position will place images so that
their right and bottom side are at location (800,&nbsp;450), which
is all the way at the right and three-fourths of the way
down the tableau.
</p>

<p>
The <code>upperCenter</code> position will place images so that their
horizontal centers are at the center of the tableau, and their vertical
centers about three-tenths down the screen.
</p>

<p>
See if you can figure out where an image at <code>rightTop</code> would
appear.
</p>

<div class="warning bordered">
<p><span class="warning">Warning:</span> because
JavaScript does not distinguish between floating point and
integers, a position of (1,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;0) will be taken to mean
100% of the width and 100% of the height of the tableau, not an absolute
location one pixel to the right and one pixel below the upper
left of the tableau. That means you will not be able to place
an image at absolute position (1,&nbsp;1).
</p>
</div>

<p>
Now that you have specified a position, you can use it to create the
<code>photo</code> character and set its initial position. The photo
doesn&#8217;t speak, so it doesn't need a name or a color.
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre>    photo = new Character("", {position: upperCenter});</pre>
</div>

<p>
The last item to define in this example is a text block. It doesn&#8217;t
really need a name either, but I put one in just as an example. If you
don&#8217;t want to name your text blocks, just put in the null
string <code>""</code>.
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre>    textArea = new TextBlock("myText");</pre>
</div>

<h3><a id="theScript">The Script</a></h3>
<p>
At last! You can finally start entering the script that tells the
characters what to do.  The following script, which consists of
pairs of items in a JavaScript array, establishes a scene and
has the narrator say something. In this script, the
little arrow (<span class="cont">&rarr;</span>) means that the line
is continued. The line numbers at the left are for reference.
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre><span class="line"> 1&nbsp;</span>script = [
<span class="line"> 2&nbsp;</span>    label, "start",
<span class="line"> 3&nbsp;</span>    scene, "hills1.jpg",
<span class="line"> 4&nbsp;</span>    n, "It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful day at Montgomery Hill Park,<span class="cont">&rarr;</span>
    where we meet Tyler the tourist, who is looking for Gavin the Guide."
<span class="line"> 5&nbsp;</span>];</pre>
</div>

<dl>
<dt>Line 2</dt>
    <dd>The label <code>"start"</code> indicates the place where the
    novel begins.</dd>
<dt>Line 3</dt>
    <dd>The <code>scene</code> command clears out any characters that
    might be on screen and sets the background to the filename
    given as the second item (<samp>"hills1.jpg"</samp> in this case).
    </dd>
<dt>Line 4</dt>
    <dd>The first item is the character name; in this case, the narrator.
    The second item gives the text the character is supposed to say.
    The text is HTML, and can contain any valid HTML. In this example,
    <code>&amp;rsquo;</code> gives a curly right single quote (&rsquo;),
    which looks better at large sizes than a straight-up-and-down quote (').
    (<a id="quotemarks" href="quotemarks.html">See an example</a>)
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>
Now add the following lines to make the characters appear and speak (they
are in bold). Note that I had to add a comma at the end of line 4 in order to avoid
a JavaScript error. <span class="warning">This is the most common cause of errors
when you write your script.</span> Always remember to add a comma to the
last line in the script before adding new lines!
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre><span class="line"> 1</span>script = [ 
<span class="line"> 2</span>    label, "start",
<span class="line"> 3</span>    scene, "hills1.jpg",
<span class="line"> 4</span>    n, "It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful day at Montgomery Hill Park,<span class="cont">&rarr;</span>
      where we meet Tyler the tourist, who is looking for Gavin the Guide."<b>,
<span class="line"> 5</span>    tyler, {image: "worried1.png", position: leftSide},
<span class="line"> 6</span>    tyler, "Hey, Gavin, where are you?"

<span class="line"> 8</span>    tyler, {image: "simple1.png"},

<span class="line">13</span>    tyler, "Much better, thanks!"</b>
<span class="line">14</span>];</pre>
</div>

<dl>
<dt>Line 5</dt>
    <dd>This line makes the character <code>tyler</code> appear
    with the given <code>image</code> at the <code>position</code> you
    specify.</dd>
<dt>Line 6</dt>
    <dd>
    When a character&rsquo;s name is followed by a string, that means
    that it is &ldquo;speech&rdquo; that should appear in the dialog area.
    </dd>
<dt>Line 7</dt>
    <dd>This line makes character <code>gavin</code> appear at the 
    specified <code>position</code> with the given <code>image</code>.
    You can specify image and position in any order you want. Ordinarily,
    you would pick one order and stay with it throughout your script.</dd>
<dt>Line 8</dt>
    <dd>Since only an image is specified, Tyler&rsquo;s image changes,
    but not his position.</dd>
<dt>Lines 9-10</dt>
    <dd>More dialog by the characters.</dd>
<dt>Line 11</dt>
    <dd>The <code>gavin</code> character&rsquo;s position has changed,
    but since no image has been specified, it stays the same as it was.
</dl>

<h3><a id="menu">Choosing from a Menu</a></h3>
<p>
At this point, the story has a branch; Tyler can choose to either see
dangerous or not-so-dangerous animals. Whenever you have a choice point
in the story, you add a menu, as shown in the following part of the script.
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre><span class="line"> 1</span>   tyler, "Much better, thanks!",

</div>

<dl>
<dt>Line 1</dt>
    <dd>Continuation of the script. The comma at the end of the line
    is required when you add more lines.</dd>
<dt>Line 3</dt>
    <dd>Although not required, it&rsquo;s a good idea to put a label on
    all your choice points so that you can jump back to a menu if you
    need to.</dd>
<dt>Line 4</dt>
    <dd>A <code>menu</code> is contained in a JavaScript array (which
    is enclosed in square brackets).</dd>
<dt>Line 5</dt>
    <dd>The first item in the array is the prompt for the reader. This
    prompt will appear, centered, in the dialog area.</dd>
<dt>Lines 6-7</dt>
    <dd>Specify each choice with the text for that choice, followed by
    an array telling the novel engine what to do when the reader chooses it.
    Line 6 will make a button with the text &ldquo;Dangerous animals&rdquo;
    appear. If the reader clicks it, she will go to the section of the
    novel that has a <code>label</code> of <samp>"wild"</samp>.
    <p>
    Similarly, line 7 makes a button with the text
    &ldquo;Not-so-dangerous animals&rdquo; appear. If the reader clicks it,
    she will go to the section of the novel that has a <code>label</code>
    of <samp>"tame"</samp>.
    </p>
    <p>
    In this example, there&rsquo;s only one thing to do as the result
    of a click&mdash;a simple jump. It is possible to do more than one thing
    as the result of a click on a menu item. This is covered in the
    advanced features section of the tutorial.
    </p>
    </dd>
<dt>Line 8</dt>
    <dd>Since the script continues, remember to put a comma after the
    closing square bracket (the opening one was on line 4).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
It is also possible to display a character&rsquo;s image and have the
character speak with one command. 
Just add a <code>say</code> property in addition to specifying the image.
The following two sequences do the same thing:
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre>// sequence 1:
tyler, {image: "loving1.png"},
tyler, "Aww, that&rsquo;s really nice.",

// sequence 2:
tyler, {image: "loving1.png", say: "Aww, that&rsquo;s really nice."},</pre>
</div>

<p>
With these simple commands, you can put together a reasonable
visual novel. <a href="exampleNovel.html">The full example is here.</a>
The only feature that it uses that has not been explained here is the
TextBlock, which is discussed in the advanced features.

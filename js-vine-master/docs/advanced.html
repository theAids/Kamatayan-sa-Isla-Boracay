<h2><a id="textblocks">Text Blocks</a></h2>
<p>
Sometimes you need a text to appear in the tableau. You use a
<code>TextBlock</code> character to do this. To initialize a
<code>TextBlock</code>, you give the block a name and optionally
parameters. Your parameters can be the following:
</p>
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr><th>Property</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr><td><code>color</code></td>
        <td>text color for this block, specified as in CSS</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>backgroundColor</code></td>
        <td>background color for this block, specified as in CSS</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>position</code></td>
        <td>where to display this text block. The <code>xAnchor</code>
        and <code>yAnchor</code> are ignored.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>align</code></td>
        <td>text alignment, specified as in CSS</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>border</code></td>
        <td>a border specification as in CSS</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>font</code></td>
        <td>the font to use to display the text</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>width</code></td>
        <td>decimal percent of width of the window; range from 0 to 1.0</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>visibility</code></td>
        <td>"visible" or "hidden", as in CSS</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>text</code></td>
        <td>an HTML string to display inside the text area</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>
The following code creates a <code>TextBlock</code> that will display
red text on a yellow background in 24 point Helvetica font, centered, in
an area 60% the width of the novel with an upper right corner at
position (50&nbsp;,70).
</p>
<div class="inset bordered">
<pre>var sampleText; // goes outside of prepareNovel()
  /* inside the prepareNovel() function, do this: */
  sampleText = new TextBlock("sample",
    {
      color: "red", backgroundColor: "#ff0",
      font: "24pt Helvetica", align: "center",
      width: 0.6,
      position: new Position(50, 70)
    }
  );</pre>
</div>

<p>
At the moment, this text block has no text in it. To make it appear
on screen with text, just mention it in your script with the text
you want it to contain.
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre>script = [
  label, "start",
  scene, "empty.png",
  sampleText, "Here I am!"
];</pre>
</div>

<p>
You can change the text block&rsquo;s attributes or text and attributes
simultaneously:
</p>

<pre>
  narrator, "Click to change colors.",
  sampleText, {color: "white", backgroundColor: "#800"},
  narrator, "Click to change the text and border",
  sampleText, {text: "New text", border: "5px double white"}
</pre>
<h2><a id="poswidth">Position and Width</a></h2>
<p>
When you set the position of a text block, the <i>x</i> and
<i>y</i> positions, if less than or equal to 1, indicate a proportion
of the novel&rsquo;s width or height. If greater than 1, they indicate
a pixel position. The xAnchor and yAnchor parameters (which are useful
when centering an image) are not used for text blocks.
</p>
<p>
Ordinarily, a text block takes up the entire width of the tableau.
If you want a block with a width of, say, 40% of the screen width,
you set <code>width:&nbsp;.40</code> If you want that block centered,
horizontally, then its <i>x</i> position must be .30
(30%&nbsp;+&nbsp;40%&nbsp;+&nbsp;30%&nbsp;=&nbsp;100%). In general,
for a text block of width <i>w</i>, you center it by setting the
<i>x</i> position to ((1&nbsp;-&nbsp;<i>w</i>)&nbsp;/&nbsp;2).
</p>

<h2><a id="initWithText">Displaying Without Changes</a></h2>
<p>
What if you included text when you initialized your 
<code>TextBlock</code>, as in the following code?
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre>var otherText; // outside prepareNovel()
/* inside prepareNovel */
otherText = new TextBlock("other",
  {
    text: "Yet more text.",
    position: new Position(0.25, 0.5),
    width: 0.5
  }
);</pre>
</div>

<p>
Or what if you had changed a scene (which clears the tableau), and
wanted to re-display some text?
How can you display the text area without changing any of its properties?
Just use <code>null</code> as the parameter in your script, and the
text area will appear, exactly as you initialized it.
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre>  /* previous part of script... */
  narrator, "See some more text.",
  otherText, null,
  narrator, "Scene switches...",
  scene, null, // clear tableau
  narrator, "And now, the colorful text again",
  sampleText, null,
  narrator, "The end"</pre>
</div>
<p>
You may see <a href="textExample/textExample.html">the full
example here</a>.
</p>

<h2><a id="showHide">Showing, Hiding, and Removing</a></h2>
<p>
While it is possible to hide and display a character this way:
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre>protagonist, {visibility: "hidden"},
// later on...
protagonist, {visibility: "visible"}</pre>
</div>

<p>
It is easier to use the show and hide commands:
</p>
<div class="inset bordered">
<pre>hide, protagonist,
// later on...
show, protagonist</pre>
</div>

<p> When you use <code>show</code>, the character will be added to the tableau
(if not there already) and will become visible.
</p>

<p>
The <code>hide</code> command makes a character invisible, but does
not remove the character from the tableau. If you really want to remove
a character, use <code>remove</code> instead of <code>hide</code>.
</p>

<p>If you have characters that overlap on the tableau, then
<code>hide</code> followed by <code>show</code> will not do the same thing
as <code>remove</code> followed by <code>show</code>. 
<a href="hideShowRemoveExample/hideShowRemoveExample.html">This example
novel shows the difference</a>.
</p>

<h2><a id="variables">Variables</a></h2>
<p>
Up to this point, the text on every page is the same, independent
of your menu choices. Take a look at
<a href="varExample/varExample.html">this simple novel</a>. You
might think that it has a structure like this (click it to see
it at full size)
</p>

<div class="center">
<a href="images/varExample_flowchart.png"><img
    src="images/varExample_flowchart.png"
    alt="flowchart showing three separate branches"
    width="283" height="225"/></a>
</div>

<p>
And indeed, you could have a separate <code>jump</code> to each
branch. However, if you look at the text, you will see that all
the branches are the same, except for places
where you can &ldquo;fill-in-the-blanks&rdquo;:
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<p>Well, if you like <span class="fillin">{{some color name}}</span>...</p>
<p>Perhaps you would like to purchase this lovely
<span class="fillin">{{name of a jewel}}</span></p>
</div>

<p>
And, if the pictures are cleverly named the same as the name of the jewels,
you can display a picture with a name of
<samp><span class="fillin">{{name of a jewel}}</span>.jpg</samp>
</p>

<p>
This is how variables in the visual novel engine work. Here is the
code for the menu that lets you choose your color:
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre><span class="line"> 1</span>&nbsp;menu, [
<span class="line"> 2</span>&nbsp;  "What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite color?",
<span class="line"> 3</span>&nbsp;  "Red", [ setVars, {color: 'red', jewel: 'ruby'} ],
<span class="line"> 4</span>&nbsp;  "Green", [ setVars, { color: 'green', jewel: 'emerald'} ],
<span class="line"> 5</span>&nbsp;  "Blue", [ setVars, "novel.userVar.color='blue'",
<span class="line"> 6</span>&nbsp;      setVars, "novel.userVar.jewel='sapphire'" ]
<span class="line"> 7</span>&nbsp;],</pre>
</div>

<p>
Lines 3 and 4 show the method you will usually use to set variables, by
giving the variable name and its value. Variable names must follow 
JavaScript rules: they must begin with a letter or underscore, followed by
letters, digits, or underscores.
</p>

<p>
<span class="warning">Important:</span>
What&rsquo;s <em>really</em> happening behind the scenes is that your
&ldquo;variables&rdquo; become part of a special object named
<code>novel.userVar</code>.  Lines 5 and 6 show the &ldquo;hard way&rdquo;
to set variables&mdash;by directly changing the <code>novel.userVar</code>
object. This is important to know so that you can use the variables
later on.  Here&rsquo;s the rest of the script: 
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre><span class="line"> 8</span>&nbsp;label,"salesPitch",
<span class="line"> 9</span>&nbsp;salesman, "Well, if you like {{novel.userVar.color}}...",
<span class="line">10</span>&nbsp;jewelPhoto, {image: "{{novel.userVar.jewel}}.jpg",
<span class="line">11</span>&nbsp;  visibility: "visible"},
<span class="line">12</span>&nbsp;salesman, "Perhaps you would like to purchase this lovely {{novel.userVar.jewel}}!",
<span class="line">13</span>&nbsp;jump, "ask"</pre>
</div>

<dl>
<dt>Line 8</dt>
    <dd>Because the menu items don&rsquo;t end with a <code>jump</code>,
    you <em>must</em> put a label afterwards; otherwise the novel engine
    will skip too far ahead. (This is not an easy thing to fix.)</dd>
<dt>Lines 9 and 11</dt>
    <dd>When you want to reference a variable, you enclose it in a
    set of double braces <code>{{&nbsp;}}</code>, and you <em>must</em>
    use the <code>novel.userVar</code> notation. The double braces
    <dfn>interpolate</dfn> the variable; that is, they 
    &ldquo;fill in the blank.&rdquo;</dd>
<dt>Line 10</dt>
    <dd>Interpolation isn&rsquo;t just for dialog. You can use it
    for file names and menu items. (<i>Ideally, interpolation will
    work anywhere you can put a quoted string, but I don&rsquo;t 
    know if I have implemented it everywhere. If you find an instance
    where it doesn&rsquo;t work, let me know.</i>)</dd>
</dl>

<p>You can <a href="varExample/varExample.js">see the entire
JavaScript here</a>.</p>

<h3>Really Advanced Topic: Using Plain JavaScript Variables</h3>
<p>
Do you <em>really</em> have to use <code>novel.userVar</code>? No,
you do not. You could create global variables in your JavaScript file:
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre>/* my own variables (instead of using novel.userVar) */
var myColor;
var myJewel;</pre>
</div>

<p>
And then do this in your script array. Notice that you can put
multiple JavaScript statements separated by
semicolons into a single <code>setVars</code>;
that&rsquo;s because it <em>is</em> JavaScript.
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre>menu, [
    "What&amp;rsquo;s your favorite color?",
    "Red", [ setVars, "myColor='red'; myJewel='ruby'" ],
    "Green", [ setVars,"myColor='green'; myJewel='emerald'" ],
    "Blue", [ setVars, "myColor='blue'; myJewel='sapphire'" ]
],
label,"salesPitch",
salesman, "Well, if you like {{myColor}}...",
jewelPhoto, {image: "{{myJewel}}.jpg", visibility: "visible"},
salesman, "Perhaps you would like to purchase this lovely {{myJewel}}!",</pre>
</div>

<p>
You are free to do this if you wish; you just have to be careful that
your variable names don&rsquo;t conflict with anything variables that
have been declared in the <samp>js-vine.js</samp> file. You can
<a href="varExample/varExample2.html">see the script in action here</a> and
<a href="varExample/varExample2.js">see the JavaScript here</a>
</p>

<h2><a id="textinput">Text Input</a></h2>
<p>
If you want to get the reader&rsquo;s input to use in your script,
you create an <code>Input</code> character, as follows:
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre>// global variable
var inputArea;

// in prepareNovel()
inputArea = new Input('yourName',
{
    position: new Position(0.2, 0.5),
    width: 0.5,
    text: "Your name here"
});</pre>
</div>

<p>The <code>Input</code> object has the same parameters as a
<code>TextBlock</code>, with one small difference: the 
<code>text:</code> property gives the default value for the input
field, and it is plain text rather than HTML.</p>

<p>The name you give the object (in this example, <code>yourName</code>)
is the name of the <code>novel.userVar</code> property that gets filled in
when the reader changes the input field.</p>

<p>
Here&rsquo;s an example of the <code>Input</code> in action. Because
the input area&rsquo;s name is <code>yourName</code>, the script
accesses it via <code>novel.userVar.yourName</code>.
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre>script = [  
    label, "start",
    scene, "wheat.png",

    inputArea, "",
    narrator, "Welcome, {{novel.userVar.yourName}}!",
    narrator, "The end."
];</pre>
</div>

<p>
<span class="warning">Note:</span> unlike a <code>TextBlock</code>,
an <code>Input</code> field is removed from the tableau as soon as the
reader has entered a value. You may
<a href="textInputExample/textInputExample.html">see the code in action
here</a>.
</p>

<h2><a id="ifStatement">The <code>ifStatement</code></a></h2>
<p>
Sometimes you will want some part of the novel to appear only if a certain
condition has been fulfilled. (For example, you may want some text to appear
only if the reader is female.) In other cases, you may want different text
to appear depending upon some condition; some extra text for female readers
and other text for male readers.  The <code>ifStatement</code> lets you
do these things.
</p>

<h3>If-then</h3>
<p>
The simplest form of an <code>ifStatement</code> is an &ldquo;if-then&rdquo;
statement, as in &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s raining, then take an umbrella.&rdquo;
You can <a href="ifExample/ifExample.html">see it in action in this
example novel</a>. You are first asked if you prefer cats or dogs. Your
choice jumps you to a different part of the novel, and the two branches
rejoin. During the last part of the novel, extra text appears only if you
said you prefer cats. Here&rsquo;s the menu, which sets a variable named
<code>animal</code> and then jumps to the appropriate part of the novel.
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre>menu, [
    "Which do you prefer?",
    "Cats", [
        setVars, { animal: "cat" },
        jump, "catPart"
    ],
    "Dogs", [
        setVars, { animal: "Dog" },
        jump, "dogPart"
    ]
],</pre>
</div>

<p>
Both branches eventually jump to <samp>"part2"</samp>, which contains
the if statement.
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre><span class="line"> 1</span>&nbsp;ifStatement, "novel.userVar.animal == 'cat'",
<span class="line"> 2</span>&nbsp;  david, {image: "smiling1.png"},
<span class="line"> 3</span>&nbsp;  david, "Especially one that purrs!",
<span class="line"> 4</span>&nbsp;  david, {image: "simple1.png"},
<span class="line"> 5</span>&nbsp;endIf, "",
<span class="line"> 6</span>&nbsp;david, "And remember: please spay or neuter your pet."</pre>
</div>

<p>
The <code>ifStatement</code> must contain a <code>condition</code> (line 1),
which is a JavaScript expression that asks a yes-or-no question.
In this case, the question is, &ldquo;is <code>novel.userVar.animal</code>
exactly equal to the string <samp>'cat'</samp>?&rdquo;
If the answer is yes, the statements in the <code>thenPart</code> (lines
2-4) are carried out. If the answer is no, the novel simply proceeds
after the <code>endIf</code>.
</p>

<p><span class="warning">Important:</span> That&rsquo;s a capital letter
<code>I</code> in <code>endIf</code>.  You have to put an <code>""</code>
after the <code>endIf</code> so that every entry in the script has two
parts.

<p>
As in JavaScript, you must use two equal signs in a row (<code>==</code>)
to test for equality. To test to see if items are not equal, use
<code>!=</code>.  Less than is <code>&lt;</code>;  greater than is
<code>&gt;</code>. Less than or equal is<code>&lt;=</code>, 
and greater than or equal is <code>&gt;=</code>.
</p>

<h3>If-then-else</h3>
<p>
The other type of <code>ifStatement</code> involves an <dfn>else</dfn>
part; something to do if the <code>condition</code> is not true. For example,
&ldquo;If I finish work before 6 p.m., then I will cook dinner;
otherwise (else) I will get some take-out food.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<a href="ifExample/ifExample2.html">Here is a slight modification of
the first example</a>. In this novel, if you choose dogs instead of
cats, you also get a special message in the last part of the novel,
as specified in the <code>elsePart</code> on line 5.
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre><span class="line"> 1</span>&nbsp;ifStatement, "novel.userVar.animal == 'cat'",
<span class="line"> 2</span>&nbsp;  david, {image: "smiling1.png"},
<span class="line"> 3</span>&nbsp;  david, "Especially one that purrs!",
<span class="line"> 4</span>&nbsp;  david, {image: "simple1.png"},
<span class="line"> 5</span>&nbsp;elsePart, "", 
<span class="line"> 6</span>&nbsp;  david, "Your dog will be a loyal companion for life.",
<span class="line"> 7</span>&nbsp;endIf, "", 
</pre>
</div>

<div class="warning bordered">
<p>
<span class="warning">Warning:</span>
Be careful about putting a <code>jump</code> inside of an
<code>ifStatement</code>. If a <code>jump</code> leads
to a destination that is outside
of the <code>ifStatement</code>, the novel engine will not
be aware that it has left the <code>ifStatement</code>, and strange things
may occur. If a <code>jump</code> from outside an
<code>ifStatement</code> goes to a destination that is inside
an <code>ifStatement</code>, the novel engine will be very confused
when it finds an <code>endIf</code> without ever having started the
<code>ifStatement</code>.
</p>
</div>

<h2><a id="subroutines">Subroutines</a></h2>
<p>
If there is a series of statements that you will do many times during
a script, you can put them in a <dfn>subroutine</dfn>, which is analogous
to a JavaScript function.
Think of it as a &ldquo;mini-script&rdquo; that you can call
upon whenever you need it. 
<a href="subExample/subExample.html">Take a look at this sample
visual novel</a>. Every time a character speaks, his picture becomes
completely opaque and the non-speaking character&rsquo;s picture becomes
transparent. Each speaker&rsquo;s code looks like this:
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre>// Make Mr. Gold the primary speaker
gold, { alpha: 1.0 },
green, { alpha: 0.3 },

// Make Mr. Green the primary speaker
gold, { alpha: 0.3 },
green, { alpha: 1.0 },</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now, you could copy and paste this code into the script every time
one of the speakers changes, but that&rsquo;s prone to error, and if
you ever decide to change the transparent alpha value, you have to change
every occurrence (another error-prone process).
</p>

<p>
The solution is to make each of these bits of a code into a
subroutine:
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre>sub, "showGold",
    gold, { alpha: 1.0 },
    green, { alpha: 0.3 },
endSub, "",
    
    sub, "showGreen",
    gold, { alpha: 0.3 },
    green, { alpha: 1.0 },
endSub, "",</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now the script makes calls to the subroutines:
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre>call, "showGold",
gold, "Hi. I am Mr. Gold.",
call, "showGreen",
green, "And I am Mr. Green.",</pre>
</div>

<h3>Where to Place Subroutines</h3>
<p>
<span class="warning"><big>Important!</big></span> Always place your
subroutines before the <code>label,&nbsp;"start",</code> line. Never
put them in the middle of your script, and don&rsquo;t put them at the end
of the script, either.
</p>

<p>
A subtle technical point, which you may skip if you don&rsquo;t care:
You may put a subroutine at the end of the script, as long as there is no way
for the script to encounter it normally, as in this sample code:
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre>narrator, "and that is the end of our story!",
narrator, "Click to see the story again.",
jump, "start",

// the engine will never get to this line
sub, "setScene",
   scene, "empty.png",
   narrator, { alpha: 1.0 },
endSub, "",</pre>
</div>

<h2><a id="audio">Audio</a></h2>
<p>
You can add sound to your novels with the <code>audio</code> command.
It has these properties:
</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr><th>Property</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr><td><code>src</code></td>
        <td>the name of the audio file you wish to play. If you
        specify a <code>format</code>, do not put an extension
        on the filename.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>format</code></td>
        <td>which file formats you provide, as an array of strings.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>loop</code></td>
        <td>a boolean that tells whether the sound should loop or not.
        Sounds do <em>not</em> loop automatically. You must set this
        when you start a sound or while it is playing.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>action</code></td>
        <td>one of:
            <code>"play"</code>, <code>"pause"</code>,
            <code>"rewind"</code>, or <code>"stop"</code>
        </td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p><span class="warning">Important:</span> If you <code>"stop"</code> the
audio, you must give the <code>src</code> when you start playing the
sound again.</p>

<p>Here is the relevant code from <a href="audioExample/audioExample.html">the
audio example</a> that shows how to manipulate audio.</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre>menu, [
    "Choose an option (loop is {{novel.audioLoop}})",
    "Start audio", [audio, {src: "scale", format: ["ogg","wav"], action: "play"}],
    "Stop audio", [audio, {action: "stop"}],
    "Pause audio", [audio, {action: "pause"}],
    "Resume audio", [audio, {action: "play"}],
    "Rewind audio", [audio, {action: "rewind"}],
    "Set loop true", [audio, {loop: true}],
    "Set loop false", [audio, {loop: false}]
],</pre>
</div>

<p>
The preceding example will first test to see if the browser
can play file <samp>scale.ogg</samp>. If it cannot, then the engine will test
to see if the browser can play file <samp>scale.wav</samp>. If you had only
provided one file, say, the Ogg Vorbis format, you would simply have put
<code>src: "scale.ogg"</code> and omitted the <code>format</code> property.
</p>

<h2><a id="background">Backgrounds</a></h2>
<p>
When changing scenes, you can specify a new background image. You
can also specify an <dfn>effect</dfn> for the transition to the new
background. Consider the following example of four scenes (we have
left out the text within each scene).  The first command makes
<samp>office.jpg</samp> the background. The next scene will simply replace
<samp>office.jpg</samp> with <samp>highway.jpg</samp> (Note: you could have
written the second command as <code>scene,&nbsp;"highway.jpg"</code>. The
next scene will fade out <samp>highway.jpg</samp> and then fade in
<samp>house.jpg</samp>.  The last scene fades out <samp>house.jpg</samp>
at the same time that <samp>kitchen.jpg</samp> fades in.
</p>

<div class="inset bordered"><pre>scene, "office.jpg",
scene, {image: "highway.jpg"},
scene, {image: "house.jpg", effect: "fade"},
scene, {image: "kitchen.jpg", effect: "dissolve"}</pre>
</div>

<p>
The <code>scene</code> command clears the tableau and dialog areas. If
you want to change a background without clearing those areas, use the
<code>background</code> command instead. It also allows you to use
an <code>effect</code>.
</p>

<p>
With either the <code>background</code> or <code>scene</code> command, you
can specify an alpha value (0=transparent, 1=opaque). This can be useful if
you want to emphasize a diagram on a &ldquo;busy&rdquo; background.
Consider the following sequence:
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre>background, {image: "house.jpg", alpha: 0.5},
background, {image: "kitchen.jpg", alpha: 0.5, effect: "dissolve"},
background, {alpha: 1.0} // kitchen image becomes opaque</pre>
</div>

<h2><a id="imagemaps">Image Maps</a></h2>
<p>
You can create an image map using the <code>&lt;map&gt;</code> element in
your HTML and then use it from within your novel&rsquo;s script.
Consider this section of code from
<a href="imageMapExample/imageMapExample.html">an image map example</a>:
</p>

<div class="inset bordered"><pre>&lt;map name="euroMap" id="euroMap"&gt;
	&lt;area shape="rect" coords="87,83,135,142"
		href="#" alt="Germany" onclick="return novel_mapJump('germany');"/&gt;
	&lt;area shape="rect" coords="50,115,108,170"
		href="#"  alt="France" onclick="return novel_mapJump('france');"/&gt;
	&lt;area shape="rect" coords="20,155,78,207"
		href="#" alt="Spain" onclick="return novel_mapJump('spain');"/&gt;
	&lt;area shape="rect" coords="114,6,148,90"
		href="#" alt="Sweden" onclick="return novel_mapJump('sweden');"/&gt;
&lt;/map&gt;</pre>
</div>

<p>
In your novel, you attach the image map to a character. The relevant code
is here:
</p>

<div class="inset bordered"><pre>var europe;

function prepareNovel()
{
    europe= new Character("",
        { position: new Position(0.5, 0.2, 0.5, 0.5) }
    );
    script = [
    label, "start",
    //...
    europe, {image: "empty_map2.png"},
    //...
    imagemap, { mapId: "euroMap", character: europe },
}</pre></div>

<p>
As soon as the script engine encounters the <code>imagemap</code>
command, it will attach the <code>&lt;map&gt;</code> with the 
<code>mapId</code> that you specify to the image currently displayed
by the <code>character</code> that you name. The novel then pauses and
waits for user interaction.
</p>

<p><span class="warning">Important: </span> 
In order to jump to a label in the script as the result of a click on
the mapped image, you <emphasis>must</emphasis> use the
<code>novel_mapjump()</code> function rather than <code>jump()</code>. The
<code>novel_mapjump()</code> function also clears the imagemap connection.
</p>

<p>
Because you have the full capabilities of an image map, you may use
the <code>onmouseover</code> and <code>onmouseout</code> attributes in
your HTML, as shown in <a href="imageMapExample/imageMapExample2.html"/>this
example</a>.
</p>

<h3>Modal and Non-modal Image Maps</h3>
<p>
In the examples, the novel will only accept clicks on the image map; if
you click outside the image map or in the dialog area, the novel will not
proceed. This is called a <dfn>modal</dfn> image map, and it is usually what
you want.
</p>

<p>
If you would like a non-modal image map that allows the novel to detect clicks
both inside and outside the image map, add the
<code>screenActive:&nbsp;true</code> property inside the braces. You can
see <a href="imageMapExample/imageMapExample3.html">an example of a
non-modal image map here</a>. Try clicking outside the shapes when the novel
asks you to select one.
</p>

<h2><a id="avatars">Dialog Avatars</a></h2>
<p>
When you have two characters on screen at the same time, it can be
confusing as to who&rsquo;s actually speaking. You can make things
easier by displaying a smaller version of the character in the dialog area.
I am calling this a &ldquo;dialog avatar.&rdquo; You create a separate
image for the avatar image. Here is an example, presuming that a character
named Francine has already been created.
</p>

<div class="inset bordered"><pre>francine, {image: "francine.jpg", avatar: "francine_avatar.jpg"},
francine, "My avatar and I both appear in the scene.,

francine, {image: ""},
francine, "Now only my avatar shows up. I could have re-specified the avatar, but I don't have to."

francine, {image: "francine.jpg", avatar: ""},
francine, "Now my image shows up, but not my avatar.</pre></div>

<p>
Avatars are also useful when you have a complicated background and
you don&rsquo;t want the full-sized characters obscuring it.
</p>

<p>
In order to make the dialog text wrap around the avatar, you must add
this to your HTML file&#8217;s stylesheet:
</p>

<div class="inset bordered"><pre>.avatar {float: left;}</pre></div>

<p>

<h2><a id="jscall">Calling JavaScript from your Novel</a></h2>
<p>
<span class="warning">For the technically advanced readers only!</span>
Sometimes you will need to call a JavaScript function to accomplish some
goal. You can put a <code>jsCall</code> into your script. It is followed
by an object that has these properties: <code>fcn</code>, which is the
name of the JavaScript function you want to call, and
<code>params</code>, which is an array of parameters to be passed to the
function. If there are no parameters, use an empty array
(<code>[&nbsp;]</code>). <a href="jsCallExample/jsCallExample.html">This
example</a> calls JavaScript to add two numbers. Here is the relevant
script, and the function it calls:
</p>

<div class="inset bordered">
<pre>
// this goes inside function prepareNovel();
script = [
    label, "start",
    scene, "empty.png",
    narrator, "Click the mouse to add 2 and 5.",
    jsCall,  { fcn: addNumbers, params: [2, 5] },
    narrator, "The result is {{novel.userVar.sum}}."
];

// and this function is elsewhere in your JavaScript file
function addNumbers(x, y)
{
    novel.userVar.sum = x + y;
}</pre>
</div>
</body>
</html>
